# sample.batch.bonuspayout

This sample makes use of the ***batch-1.0*** and ***batchManagement-1.0*** features of the WebSphere Liberty Profile.
It uses the *batchManager* command-line utility to conveniently wrapper the REST-based remote dispatch and management interface.

It involves a three-step job, which generates some random data, performs a calculation on it (writing the result into the database), and then verifies the result.

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:

* [Building and running with Maven][1]
* [Using Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)][2]
* [Using WDT and Maven at the same time][3]
* [Run the sample manually from the command line][4]
* [Take a deeper look at the sample application][5]

## Acknowledgements

* As noted in the [maven integration](/docs/Maven-integration.md) page, this sample uses the [Liberty maven](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven) plugin
* Uses [ExpectIt](https://github.com/Alexey1Gavrilov/ExpectIt) for testing the ***batchManager*** command-line output

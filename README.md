# sample.batch.bonuspayout

This sample makes use of the ***batch-1.0*** and ***batchManagement-1.0*** features of the WebSphere Liberty Profile.
It uses the *batchManager* command-line utility to conveniently wrapper the REST-based remote dispatch and management interface.

It involves a three-step job, which generates some random data, performs a calculation on it (writing the result into the database), and then verifies the result.

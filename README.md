# sample.batch.bonuspayout

This sample makes use of the ***batch-1.0*** and ***batchManagement-1.0*** features of the WebSphere Liberty Profile.
It uses the *batchManager* command-line utility to conveniently wrapper the REST-based remote dispatch and management interface.

It involves a three-step job, which generates some random data, performs a calculation on it (writing the result into the database), and then verifies the result.

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:

* [Building and running with Maven](/docs/Maven-integration.md)
* [Using Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)](/docs/Using-WDT.md)
* [Downloading WAS Liberty](/docs/Downloading-WAS-Liberty.md)
* [Run the sample manually from the command line](/docs/Running-manually-from-CLI.md)
* [Take a deeper look at the sample application](/docs/ApplicationDetails.md)
* [Organizing the project to support WDT publish and deploy within Maven build] (/docs/Using-Maven-With-WDT-Published-App.md)

## Further reading

* [A nice set of documents](https://www.ibm.com/support/techdocs/atsmastr.nsf/WebIndex/WP102544) describing Java Batch in WebSphere at various levels of detail (WP102544)
* [The sleepy batchlet sample](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.batch.sleepybatchlet), a simpler sample using just the ***batch-1.0*** feature and thus just the Java Batch 1.0 API, without the managed batch features.

## Acknowledgements

* As noted in the [maven integration](/docs/Maven-integration.md) page, this sample uses the [Liberty maven](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.maven) plugin
* Uses [ExpectIt](https://github.com/Alexey1Gavrilov/ExpectIt) for testing the ***batchManager*** command-line output

# sample.batch.bonuspayout

This sample makes use of the ***batch-1.0*** and ***batchManagement-1.0*** features of the WebSphere Liberty Profile.
It uses the *batchManager* command-line utility to conveniently wrapper the REST-based remote dispatch and management interface.

It involves a three-step job, which generates some random data, performs a calculation on it (writing the result into the database), and then verifies the result.

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:

* [Building with maven](/docs/Building-the-sample.md#building-with-maven)
* [Downloading WAS Liberty](/docs/Downloading-WAS-Liberty.md)
* [Run the sample using the command line, or Maven/Gradle plugins](/docs/Running-the-sample.md)
* [Using Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)](/docs/Using-WDT.md)
* [Take a deeper look at the sample application](ApplicationDetails.md)
* TODO - Add Gradle build instructions
